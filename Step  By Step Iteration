Step-by-step iteration:

1) We start with an empty currentCombination vector.

2) We iterate over each subscription (TOI, Hindu, ET, BM, HT) and add it to the currentCombination.

3)  We move to the next day and repeat the process for each subscription.

4) Once we reach the end of the week, we calculate the total cost of the currentCombination.

5) If the total cost is within the budget, we add the currentCombination to the combinations vector.

6) We backtrack by removing the last added subscription from the currentCombination and continue the iteration with other subscriptions.

7) We repeat this process for all possible combinations.

8) Finally, we display the possible combinations of subscriptions within the budget.

This approach ensures that all possible combinations are considered, and only the combinations within the budget are stored and displayed
